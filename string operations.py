'''string are immutable hence whenever we perform a function on string it always makes
a copy of it and then performs the function on it and not on the orignal string ie once
created it is immutable but as we cant change it string we can overrde it with another
ie by declaring it again as python always takes the latest decleration of the any variable if
declared more than one time'''
